This repository contains code, plots and data supplementing the article "Admixture across language domains" submitted for revision in X.
The repository is structured as follows:
- the folder _code_ contains the scripts that were run to generate and analyse the results; the files used to run STRUCTURE in the command line are stored in the folder _run_structure_;
- the folder _data_ contains raw outfiles (_outfiles_), files with admixture proportions per language (_outfiles_cleaned_)  and files with feature contributions (_feature_contributions_). Apart from these folders, there is a file with statistics for each run and each K across three language domains (_outfile.txt_, generated by the script _code/collect_outfiles.py_), a file with language classifications and coordinates (_languages_map.tsv_) and a file with feature classifications (_feature_set.txt_);
- the folder _plots_ contains the plots used in the paper (generated directly by the scripts).
